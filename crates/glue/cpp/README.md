Roc standard library in C++
===========================

C++ representations of Roc's standard library data structures.
These classes are designed for developing Roc platforms using C++.
Create C++ data structures that can be passed directly to a Roc app,
and used to interpret its return values.

The header files will be imported as strings into CppGlue.roc.
